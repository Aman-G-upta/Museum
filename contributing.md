## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs üêõ
- **Search for existing issues**: Before creating a new bug report, check if the issue has already been reported.

### 3. Submitting Code Changes üõ†Ô∏è
- **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Include screenshots**: If applicable, include screenshots to help reviewers understand UI changes.

## Branching Model

- **Feature branches**: Use a descriptive branch name for new features or fixes.
  
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

- **Main branch**: The `main` branch should always reflect the production-ready state of the project. Never commit directly to the `main` branch.
